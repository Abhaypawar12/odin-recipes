# odin-recipes

Hello everyone!!!

This project in odin series will be my first one.
It will be about getting a clear understanding of html and getiing in dome practice.
I will be writing about pav bhaji my comfort dish. And might sprinkle in a few other recipes.


In this project i'll demonstrate my understanding of basics of html mainly links and images 
and a bit of working with text and th e html Boilerplate( i probably might just end up using shortcut for that).
