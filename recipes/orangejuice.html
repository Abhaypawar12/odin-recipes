    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Fresh orange juice takes a little work, but it tastes much better than orange juice from concentrate.
        I came up with this recipe in response to a request about how to make fresh-squeezed orange juice.
        You may also use a citrus reamer to do this. If you want less pulp, use a hand juicer with a strainer.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Oranges</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Lightly smack each orange on the counter. Cut each orange in half and squeeze juice into a glass.</li>
    </ol>
